## Release History 

### 2.0.0-alpha

Beginning a fairly major refactor. Removing as many libraries as I can that are not included in the standard
Arduino IDE -> Manage Libraries interface. 

Also focusing heavily on refactoring for performance, more sanitary debug, and code style. 

### 1.0.0

Initial build, before the migration to github. 
There are some incompatibilities with the latest Arduino IDE version in the menuBackend library used in this branch.
